# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current blog editor application has several critical UX issues that prevent users from having an intuitive and professional experience. The dashboard has poor visual design, confusing navigation, and incorrect behavior when creating new posts. Additionally, new users lack proper onboarding to set up their writing profile, which is essential for the AI-powered features to work effectively. This feature will transform the application into a professional, intuitive platform that guides users through proper onboarding and provides a polished dashboard experience.
