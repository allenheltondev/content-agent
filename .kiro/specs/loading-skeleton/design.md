# Design Document

## Overview

The loading skeleton system will replace the current full-screen loading spinner with component-specific skeleton placeholders that match the final layout of the editor page.liminates the jarring visual transitions and layout shifts that occur during the 2-second loading period when data is being fetched and components are initializing.

The solution implements a progressive loading approach where skeleton components are shown immediately while data loads, then smoothly transition to real content as it becomes available. This creates a professional, polished user experience similar to modern applications like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Notion.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
EditorPage
├── AppHeader (always renders immediately)
├── EditorSkeleton (shown during loading)
│   ├── EditorHeaderSkeleton
│   ├── TitleEditorSkeleton
│   ├── ContentEditorSkeleton
│   └── EditorActionsSkeleton
└── Actual Editor Components (shown after loading)
    ├── EditorHeader
    ├── TitleEditor
    ├── ContentEditorWithSuggestions
    └── EditorActions
```

### Loading State Management

The loading skeleton will be controlled by the existing `isLoading` state in EditorPage. The transition logic will be:

1. **Initial Load**: Show skeleton immediately
2. **Data Fetching**: Skeleton remains visible with subtle animations
3. **Data Ready**: Smooth transition from skeleton to real components
4. **Error State**: Graceful fallback from skeleton to error UI

### Skeleton Animation System

All skeleton components will use a consistent shimmer animation created with CSS gradients and transforms. The animation will be subtle and professional, indicating active loading without being distracting.

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Skeleton Components

#### 1. EditorSkeleton
Main container component that orchestrates the skeleton layout.

```typescript
interface EditorSkeletonProps {
  isNewPost?: boolean;
}
```

#### 2. EditorHeaderSkeleton
Mimics the EditorHeader layout with back button, title, save status, and save button placeholders.

```typescript
interface EditorHeaderSkeletonProps {
  isNewPost?: boolean;
}
```

#### 3. TitleEditorSkeleton
Provides a placeholder for the title input field with proper dimensions and styling.

```typescript
interface TitleEditorSkeletonProps {
  // No props needed - static layout
}
```

#### 4. ContentEditorSkeleton
Creates placeholder content blocks that represent typical blog post content structure.

```typescript
interface ContentEditorSkeletonProps {
  // No props needed - static layout
}
```

#### 5. EditorActionsSkeleton
Shows placeholders for the bottom action buttons (Save, Submit for Review, Finalize).

```typescript
interface EditorActionsSkeletonProps {
  isNewPost?: boolean;
}
```

### Shared Skeleton Utilities

#### SkeletonBase Component
Reusable base component for creating skeleton elements with consistent styling and animation.

```typescript
interface SkeletonBaseProps {
  width?: string | number;
  height?: string | number;
  className?: string;
  rounded?: 'none' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'full';
  animate?: boolean;
}
```

#### Shimmer Animation Hook
Custom hook for managing shimmer animations and performance optimization.

```typescript
interface UseShimmerOptions {
  enabled?: boolean;
  duration?: number;
  delay?: number;
}

const useShimmer = (options?: UseShimmerOptions) => {
  // Returns animation classes and controls
}
```

## Data Models

### Skeleton Configuration
Configuration object for customizing skeleton behavior across the application.

```typescript
interface SkeletonConfig {
  animationDuration: number;
  animationDelay: number;
  shimmerColor: string;
  backgroundColor: string;
  borderRadius: string;
  enableAnimations: boolean;
}
```

### Loading State Types
Enhanced loading state management for granular control.

```typescript
type LoadingState = 'initial' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error';

interface EditorLoadingState {
  overall: LoadingState;
  post: LoadingState;
  suggestions: LoadingState;
  profile: LoadingState;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Skeleton Error States
If data loading fails, the skeleton system will gracefully transition to error states rather than abruptly switching to error components.

1. **Timeout Handling**: If loading takes longer than expected (>10 seconds), show enhanced skeleton with progress indicators
2. **Error Transition**: Smooth fade from skeleton to error UI
3. **Retry Integration**: Error states can transition back to skeleton during retry attempts

### Performance Safeguards
- Animation performance monitoring to disable animations on low-end devices
- Memory usage tracking for skeleton components
- Automatic cleanup of animation timers and observers

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons of skeleton states vs. loaded states
- Layout stability measurements during transitions
- Animation performance benchmarks

### Unit Testing Approach
- Test skeleton component rendering with different props
- Verify animation timing and cleanup
- Test loading state transitions
- Validate accessibility attributes

### Integration Testing
- Test complete loading flow from skeleton to content
- Verify smooth transitions without layout shifts
- Test error state transitions
- Validate keyboard navigation during skeleton states

### Performance Testing
- Measure First Contentful Paint (FCP) improvements
- Track Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) reduction
- Monitor animation frame rates
- Test memory usage during extended skeleton display

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility with skeleton states
- Keyboard navigation during loading
- Focus management during transitions
- ARIA live region announcements for loading progress
