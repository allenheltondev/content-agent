# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses three critical user experience issues that are making the blog editor unusable: authentication persistence failing on page refresh, title editor styling and usability problems, and severe content flickering that makes editing impossible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to remain logged in when I refresh any page in the application, so that I don't have to constantly re-authenticate and lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated AND refreshes any page THEN the system SHALL maintain their authentication state
2. WHEN a user returns to the application after closing the browser THEN the system SHALL restore their authentication if tokens are still valid
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh them automatically before redirecting to login
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with a clear message about session expiration
5. WHEN a user navigates between pages THEN their authentication state SHALL persist without requiring re-login
6. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check for existing valid authentication before showing login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the title editor to be clearly visible and editable, so that I can easily modify my post titles without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the editor page THEN the title field SHALL have a font size of at least 24px for clear visibility
2. WHEN a user hovers over the title field THEN it SHALL show visual indicators that it is editable (cursor change, border highlight)
3. WHEN a user clicks on the title field THEN it SHALL immediately become focused and editable
4. WHEN the title field is focused THEN it SHALL have a clear visual border and background to indicate active editing state
5. WHEN the title field is empty THEN it SHALL show placeholder text "Enter your title here" in a lighter color
6. WHEN a user types in the title field THEN the text SHALL be clearly visible with proper contrast

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the editor content to remain stable while I'm typing, so that I can write without experiencing jarring visual shifts and flickering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the content editor THEN the content SHALL NOT flicker, shift, or re-render repeatedly
2. WHEN the editor loads draft content THEN it SHALL render once and remain stable
3. WHEN auto-save occurs THEN it SHALL NOT cause visible content re-rendering or position shifts
4. WHEN suggestions are loaded THEN they SHALL NOT cause the main content area to flicker or jump
5. WHEN the user switches between draft and published content THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without flickering
6. WHEN any background processes run THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with the visual stability of the editor content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the draft found dialog to only appear when I actually need to make a decision about draft recovery, so that I don't experience jarring UI flashes when loading the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the editor page AND no draft exists THEN the system SHALL NOT display the draft found dialog
2. WHEN a user navigates to the editor page AND a draft exists AND the draft is less than 5 seconds old THEN the system SHALL NOT display the draft found dialog immediately
3. WHEN a user navigates to the editor page AND a draft exists AND the draft is more than 5 seconds old THEN the system SHALL display the draft found dialog after a 500ms delay
4. WHEN the draft found dialog appears THEN it SHALL remain visible until the user makes a selection
5. WHEN a user dismisses the draft dialog THEN it SHALL not reappear during the same session
