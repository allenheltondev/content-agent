# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user experience of the suggestions system in the blog editor by improving visual highlighting, compacting the suggestions list, repositioning the summary, updating terminology, streamlining UI elements, and fixing API integration issues. The goal is to create a more professional, intuitive, and visually appealing suggestions interface that helps writers improve their content effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to see suggestions highlighted directly in my content with color-coded indicators, so that I can quickly identify areas that need attention without having to cross-reference between the editor and suggestions list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a suggestion exists for a text segment THEN the system SHALL highlight that text in the editor with the same color as the suggestion type
2. WHEN a user hovers over highlighted text THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip or preview of the related suggestion
3. WHEN multiple suggestions overlap on the same text THEN the system SHALL use a combined visual indicator or prioritize the most important suggestion type
4. WHEN a suggestion is accepted or dismissed THEN the system SHALL immediately remove the highlighting from the corresponding text
5. WHEN the editor content changes THEN the system SHALL update highlighting positions to match the current text layout
6. WHEN a user clicks on highlighted text THEN the system SHALL scroll to and expand the corresponding suggestion in the sidebar

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the suggestions list to be compact and organized by content position, so that I can efficiently review suggestions without visual clutter and in the order they appear in my writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the suggestions list loads THEN all suggestions SHALL be displayed in a minimized, compact format by default
2. WHEN suggestions are displayed THEN they SHALL be sorted by their position in the content from top to bottom
3. WHEN a suggestion is in minimized state THEN it SHALL show only essential information (type, brief preview, action buttons)
4. WHEN a user clicks anywhere on a suggestion item THEN it SHALL expand to show full details
5. WHEN a suggestion is expanded THEN it SHALL NOT display position information as this is redundant
6. WHEN multiple suggestions exist THEN they SHALL NOT be grouped by type, only sorted by content position
7. WHEN the suggestions list is displayed THEN it SHALL use efficient spacing to maximize the number of visible suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the content summary to be prominently displayed above my content, so that I can easily see the overall analysis of my writing without it being hidden in a sidebar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor page loads with content THEN the summary SHALL be displayed above the main content area
2. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinct and prominent, clearly indicating it's a summary
3. WHEN the summary contains multiple insights THEN they SHALL be organized in a scannable format
4. WHEN the content changes significantly THEN the summary SHALL update to reflect the new analysis
5. WHEN no summary is available THEN the summary area SHALL either be hidden or show a loading state
6. WHEN the summary is displayed THEN it SHALL not interfere with the main editing experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the suggestions section to be labeled appropriately to reflect that these are suggestions to improve my writing quality, so that I understand their purpose clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the suggestions section is displayed THEN it SHALL be labeled "Writing Improvements" or similar terminology that indicates quality enhancement
2. WHEN suggestions are categorized THEN the categories SHALL use clear, writer-friendly language
3. WHEN suggestion descriptions are shown THEN they SHALL explain how the suggestion improves the writing rather than just identifying issues
4. WHEN the interface refers to suggestions THEN it SHALL avoid terminology that implies the content was AI-generated
5. WHEN help text or tooltips are displayed THEN they SHALL clarify that suggestions help make writing more engaging and professional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want suggestion action buttons to be appropriately sized and professional-looking, so that the interface feels polished and doesn't distract from the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suggestion action buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL be compact and proportionally sized to the suggestion item
2. WHEN buttons are rendered THEN they SHALL use professional styling consistent with the overall application design
3. WHEN a user hovers over action buttons THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback without being overly prominent
4. WHEN multiple buttons are present THEN they SHALL be properly spaced and aligned
5. WHEN buttons are clicked THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback of the action taken
6. WHEN the interface is viewed on different screen sizes THEN buttons SHALL remain appropriately sized and accessible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want suggestion actions to work correctly with proper post identification, so that I can accept, dismiss, or modify suggestions without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks any suggestion action button THEN the system SHALL correctly identify the current post ID
2. WHEN API calls are made for suggestion actions THEN they SHALL include all required parameters including post ID
3. WHEN a suggestion action fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear, actionable error message
4. WHEN a suggestion action succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately to reflect the change
5. WHEN multiple suggestion actions are performed THEN each SHALL be processed independently without interfering with others
