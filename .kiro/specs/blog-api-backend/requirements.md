# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing the backend authentication and API structure for the blog writing application. The system will provide Amazon Cognito-based authentication with tenant isolation, REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on blog posts, and secure multi-tenant data access. The backend will automatically generate tenant IDs for new users and include them in JWT tokens for frontend consumption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up for the blog writing application, so that I can create an account and start writing blog posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs up through Cognito THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique tenantId for them
2. WHEN the tenantId is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in the user's Cognito profile as a custom attribute
3. WHEN user registration completes THEN the system SHALL include the tenantId in all subsequent JWT tokens
4. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password requirements
5. WHEN signup fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages to the frontend

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log into the blog writing application, so that I can access my blog posts and continue writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them through Cognito
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token containing the user's tenantId
3. WHEN the JWT token is issued THEN the system SHALL include standard claims (sub, email) and custom tenantId claim
4. WHEN login fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL provide token refresh capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to create new blog posts, so that I can start writing content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a POST request to /api/posts THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and extract tenantId
2. WHEN creating a new post THEN the system SHALL generate a unique contentId and associate it with the user's tenantId
3. WHEN a post is created THEN the system SHALL store it in DynamoDB with proper tenant isolation
4. WHEN the post is saved THEN the system SHALL return the created post with id, timestamps, and metadata
5. WHEN creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve my blog posts, so that I can view and select posts to edit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to /api/posts THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token and extract tenantId
2. WHEN retrieving posts THEN the system SHALL only return posts belonging to the authenticated user's tenant
3. WHEN posts are returned THEN the system SHALL include all necessary metadata (id, title, status, timestamps)
4. WHEN no posts exist THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with 200 status code
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401 status code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve a specific blog post, so that I can load it into the editor for modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to /api/posts/{id} THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and tenantId
2. WHEN retrieving a specific post THEN the system SHALL verify the post belongs to the user's tenant
3. WHEN the post exists and belongs to the user THEN the system SHALL return the complete post data
4. WHEN the post doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 status code
5. WHEN the post belongs to a different tenant THEN the system SHALL return 403 status code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to update my blog posts, so that I can modify content and save changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a PUT request to /api/posts/{id} THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and tenantId
2. WHEN updating a post THEN the system SHALL verify the post belongs to the user's tenant
3. WHEN the update is valid THEN the system SHALL save changes and increment the version number
4. WHEN the update succeeds THEN the system SHALL return the updated post with new timestamp
5. WHEN the post doesn't belong to the user THEN the system SHALL return 403 status code

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete my blog posts, so that I can remove content I no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a DELETE request to /api/posts/{id} THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and tenantId
2. WHEN deleting a post THEN the system SHALL verify the post belongs to the user's tenant
3. WHEN the deletion is authorized THEN the system SHALL remove the post from DynamoDB
4. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 204 status code
5. WHEN the post doesn't belong to the user THEN the system SHALL return 403 status code

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all API endpoints to enforce tenant isolation, so that users can only access their own data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL extract tenantId from the JWT token
2. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use tenantId as part of the DynamoDB key structure
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL never return data from other tenants
4. WHEN an invalid or missing tenantId is detected THEN the system SHALL return 401 status code
5. WHEN DynamoDB operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use composite keys with tenantId prefix

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to follow REST conventions and return appropriate HTTP status codes, so that the frontend can handle responses correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API operations succeed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 2xx status codes
2. WHEN client errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 4xx status codes with error details
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return 5xx status codes without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 400 status code with validation error details
5. WHEN resources are not found THEN the system SHALL return 404 status code

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve suggestions for my blog posts, so that I can see AI-generated recommendations for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to /api/posts/{id}/suggestions THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and tenantId
2. WHEN retrieving suggestions THEN the system SHALL verify the post belongs to the user's tenant
3. WHEN suggestions exist for the post THEN the system SHALL return all suggestions with complete metadata
4. WHEN no suggestions exist THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with 200 status code
5. WHEN the post doesn't belong to the user THEN the system SHALL return 403 status code

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to delete individual suggestions, so that I can remove suggestions I've rejected or no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a DELETE request to /api/suggestions/{id} THEN the system SHALL validate JWT token and tenantId
2. WHEN deleting a suggestion THEN the system SHALL verify the suggestion belongs to a post owned by the user's tenant
3. WHEN the deletion is authorized THEN the system SHALL remove the suggestion from DynamoDB
4. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 204 status code
5. WHEN the suggestion doesn't belong to the user's tenant THEN the system SHALL return 403 status code

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to integrate with the existing Lambda architecture, so that it leverages current infrastructure and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL use AWS Lambda functions following existing patterns
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use the existing DynamoDB table with proper key structure
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing AWS infrastructure
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL follow established error handling and logging patterns
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use the existing SAM template structure
