# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a React-based user interface for a blog writing application that focuses on drafting and editing blog posts with AI-powered suggestions. The interface will be decoupled from the backend and communicate via REST APIs. Authors can create new posts, edit existing ones, and interact with AI suggestions through an intuitive accept/reject workflow.

## Requirements

5. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include the Cognito JWT token for backend authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an author, I want to create a new blog post, so that I can start writing content from scratch.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an author, I want to edit an existing blog post, so that I can modify and improve my previously created content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an author selects an existing post from their dashboard THEN the system SHALL load the post content into the editor
2. WHEN an author modifies existing content THEN the system SHALL track changes and save drafts automatically
3. WHEN an author saves changes THEN the system SHALL send a PUT request to the REST API to update the post
4. WHEN loading an existing post THEN the system SHALL retrieve AI suggestions from the backend API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an author, I want to see AI-powered suggestions for improving my content, so that I can enhance the quality of my blog posts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing an existing post THEN the system SHALL display AI suggestions as highlighted text overlays
2. WHEN a suggestion is available THEN the system SHALL highlight the relevant text section with visual indicators
3. WHEN an author hovers over a highlighted section THEN the system SHALL display the suggestion details and Accept/Reject buttons
4. WHEN suggestions are loaded THEN the system SHALL integrate with the create-suggestions.mjs backend tool

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an author, I want to accept or reject AI suggestions with one click, so that I can efficiently review and apply improvements to my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an author clicks "Accept" on a suggestion THEN the system SHALL apply the suggested change to the content locally
2. WHEN an author clicks "Reject" on a suggestion THEN the system SHALL remove the suggestion from the interface
3. WHEN a suggestion is accepted THEN the system SHALL remove the suggestion highlight and update the content
4. WHEN a suggestion is rejected THEN the system SHALL delete the suggestion data locally
5. WHEN any suggestion action is taken THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately without page refresh

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an author, I want to submit my draft for additional review or finalize it, so that I can complete my writing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an author has finished reviewing suggestions THEN the system SHALL display "Submit for Review" and "Finalize Draft" options
2. WHEN an author clicks "Submit for Review" THEN the system SHALL send the draft to the backend for additional AI analysis
3. WHEN an author clicks "Finalize Draft" THEN the system SHALL mark the post as complete and save the final version
4. WHEN either action is taken THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and update the post status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an author, I want the interface to be responsive and built with modern web technologies, so that I have a smooth and professional editing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use React as the frontend framework
2. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool
3. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for all visual components

5. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL communicate with the backend exclusively through REST endpoints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an author, I want the frontend to be decoupled from the backend, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN the system SHALL make REST API calls to retrieve blog posts and suggestions
2. WHEN the frontend updates data THEN the system SHALL use REST API endpoints for all CRUD operations
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be able to run independently of the backend services
4. WHEN API endpoints change THEN the system SHALL only require frontend configuration updates, not code changes
