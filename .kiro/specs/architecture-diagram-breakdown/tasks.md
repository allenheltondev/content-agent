# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create high-level system overview diagram





  - Extract major architectural layers from the comprehensive diagram
  - Create simplified Mermaid diagram with 10-12 nodes showing Frontend, API Gateway, Core Services, AI Agents, and Data Storage layers
  - Add explanatory text describing the high-level flow and purpose
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Create AI agents and Nova models focused diagram





  - Build Mermaid diagram showing all five specialized agents with their Nova model annotations
  - Include Bedrock AgentCore memory system and agent tools relationships
  - Add explanatory text about agent specialization and memory persistence
  - Include key components list explaining each agent's role
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Create API layer and authentication focused diagram





  - Design Mermaid diagram showing API Gateway, Lambda Authorizer, and Cognito integration
  - Include main CRUD Lambda functions and JWT validation flow
  - Add explanatory text about request lifecycle and security model
  - Document the authentication and authorization patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Create event-driven workflow focused diagram





  - Build Mermaid diagram showing EventBridge, Step Functions, and agent orchestration
  - Include parallel agent execution and post-processing pipeline
  - Add explanatory text about async processing and workflow coordination
  - Document the event triggers and notification flow
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Create data storage architecture focused diagram
  - Design Mermaid diagram showing DynamoDB, S3, and data access patterns
  - Include main data entities and multi-tenant isolation patterns
  - Add explanatory text about storage design and data flow
  - Document the key data relationships and access patterns
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Restructure README architecture section with new organization
  - Create new section structure with clear headings for each diagram type
  - Add navigation and context between different architectural views
  - Include audience guidance for when to use each diagram
  - Maintain the existing comprehensive diagram as "Complete System Diagram (Reference)"
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 7. Add cross-references and explanatory content





  - Include brief explanations for each focused diagram describing its purpose and scope
  - Add "Key Components" and "Notable Patterns" sections for each diagram
  - Create cross-reference links between related diagrams
  - Ensure logical flow from high-level to detailed architectural views
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_
