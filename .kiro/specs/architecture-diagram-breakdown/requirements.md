# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current README contains a comprehensive architecture diagram that accurately represents the entire Betterer system, but its size and complexity make it difficult for readers to understand specific aspects of the architecture. We need to break down this monolithic diagram into smaller, focused diagrams that highlight different architectural concerns while maintaining the existing comprehensive diagram as a reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer reading the README, I want to understand the high-level system architecture without being overwhelmed by implementation details, so that I can quickly grasp how the major components interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the README THEN they SHALL see a high-level system overview diagram that shows only the major architectural layers
2. WHEN viewing the high-level diagram THEN the system SHALL show Frontend, API Gateway, Core Services, AI Agents, and Data Storage as distinct layers
3. WHEN examining the high-level diagram THEN it SHALL be no more than 10-15 nodes to maintain clarity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer interested in the AI capabilities, I want to see a focused diagram of the AI agent architecture, so that I can understand how the Nova models and Bedrock AgentCore work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the AI agents section THEN they SHALL see a dedicated diagram showing the five specialized agents
2. WHEN examining the AI diagram THEN it SHALL clearly show which Nova model each agent uses
3. WHEN viewing the AI diagram THEN it SHALL illustrate the connection to Bedrock AgentCore memory
4. WHEN looking at the AI diagram THEN it SHALL show the agent tools and their relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on the API layer, I want to see a focused diagram of the API and authentication flow, so that I can understand the request lifecycle and security model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the API section THEN they SHALL see a diagram focused on API Gateway, Lambda functions, and authentication
2. WHEN examining the API diagram THEN it SHALL show the JWT validation flow through the Lambda authorizer
3. WHEN viewing the API diagram THEN it SHALL illustrate Cognito integration and user management
4. WHEN looking at the API diagram THEN it SHALL show the main CRUD operations for posts and suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer understanding the event-driven architecture, I want to see a focused diagram of the workflow orchestration, so that I can understand how content analysis is triggered and coordinated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the workflow section THEN they SHALL see a diagram showing EventBridge, Step Functions, and agent coordination
2. WHEN examining the workflow diagram THEN it SHALL show how content review triggers the analysis pipeline
3. WHEN viewing the workflow diagram THEN it SHALL illustrate parallel agent execution
4. WHEN looking at the workflow diagram THEN it SHALL show the post-processing and notification flow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with data storage, I want to see a focused diagram of the data architecture, so that I can understand how content, suggestions, and user data are stored and accessed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer views the data section THEN they SHALL see a diagram focused on DynamoDB, S3, and data flow
2. WHEN examining the data diagram THEN it SHALL show the main data entities and their relationships
3. WHEN viewing the data diagram THEN it SHALL illustrate how different Lambda functions interact with storage
4. WHEN looking at the data diagram THEN it SHALL show the multi-tenant data isolation pattern

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer reading the README, I want the existing comprehensive diagram to remain available as a complete reference, so that I can see the full system when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs the complete picture THEN they SHALL still have access to the current comprehensive diagram
2. WHEN viewing the comprehensive diagram THEN it SHALL remain unchanged in terms of completeness and detail
3. WHEN examining the comprehensive diagram THEN it SHALL be clearly labeled as the complete system overview
4. WHEN looking at the focused diagrams THEN they SHALL reference back to the comprehensive diagram for context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer navigating the README, I want clear section organization and navigation between diagrams, so that I can easily find the architectural view most relevant to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the architecture section THEN they SHALL see clear headings for each diagram type
2. WHEN viewing any focused diagram THEN it SHALL have a brief explanation of what it shows
3. WHEN examining the diagrams THEN they SHALL be organized in a logical flow from high-level to detailed
4. WHEN navigating between diagrams THEN the text SHALL provide context about how they relate to each other
