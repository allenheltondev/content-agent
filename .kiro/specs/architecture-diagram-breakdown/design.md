# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines how to restructure the README's architecture section by breaking down the comprehensive Mermaid diagram into five focused diagrams, each highlighting a specific architectural concern. The approach maintains the existing comprehensive diagram while adding targeted views that make the system more approachable for different audiences and use cases.

## Architecture

### Diagram Hierarchy Strategy

The new architecture section will follow a progressive disclosure pattern:

1. **High-Level System Overview** - Entry point showing major architectural layers
2. **Focused Domain Diagrams** - Four specialized views for different concerns
3. **Comprehensive Reference** - The existing detailed diagram as complete reference

### Section Organization

```

**Components to Include:**
- All five specialized agents with Nova model annotations
- Bedrock AgentCore memory system
- Agent tools (grouped by function)
- Memory bootstrap process
- Tool-to-agent relationships

**Components to Exclude:**
- API layer details
- Frontend components

- Non-AI Lambda functions

### 3. API Layer & Authentication

**Purpose:** Focus on request lifecycle, security, and CRUD operations
**Audience:** Developers working on API endpoints or aon
**Complexity:** 12-15 nodes

**Components to Include:**
- API Gateway with routes
- Lambda Authorizer
- Cognito User Pool with triggers
- Main CRUD Lambda functions
- JWT validation flow
- Profile management endpoints

**Components to Exclude:**
- AI agents and tools
- Step Functions workflow
- Detailed data storage
- External integrations

### 4. Event-Driven Workflow

**Purpose:** Show how content analysis is orchestrated through events
**Audience:** Developers working on workflow orchestration or understanding async processing
**Complexity:** 10-14 nodes

**Components to Include:**
- EventBridge event routing
- Step Functions state machine
- Agent orchestration flow
- Post-processing pipeline
- Momento notifications
- Trigger events from API functions

**Components to Exclude:**
- Individual agent internals
- Authentication details
- Frontend components
- Detailed data schemas

### 5. Data Storage Architecture

**Purpose:** Focus on data models, storage patterns, and multi-tenancy
**Audience:** Developers working on data layer or understanding storage patterns
**Complexity:** 12-16 nodes

**Components to Include:**
- DynamoDB with key access patterns
- S3 content storage
- SSM Parameter Store for configuration
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Main data entities (Posts, Suggestions, Profiles)
- Lambda functions that interact with storage

**Components to Exclude:**
- AI agent details
- Authentication flows
- Event orchestration
- External API integrations

## Data Models

### Diagram Metadata Structure

Each focused diagram will include:

```markdown
### [Diagram Title]

**Focus:** Brief description of what this diagram shows
**Use Case:** When to reference this diagram
**Related Sections:** Links to other relevant diagrams

[Mermaid Diagram]

**Key Components:**
- Component 1: Brief explanation
- Component 2: Brief explanation
- ...

**Notable Patterns:**
- Pattern 1: Why this pattern is used
- Pattern 2: Benefits of this approach
```

### Cross-Reference System

Each diagram section will include:
- Forward references to related diagrams
- Back references to the comprehensive diagram
- Context about what's intentionally excluded

## Error Handling

### Diagram Complexity Management

**Problem:** Risk of focused diagrams becoming too complex
**Solution:** Strict node count limits and regular complexity audits

**Problem:** Loss of important connections between systems
**Solution:** Cross-reference annotations and "see also" sections

### Content Synchronization

**Problem:** Focused diagrams becoming outdated when comprehensive diagram changes
**Solution:** Clear documentation about which elements belong in each focused view

## Testing Strategy

### Diagram Validation Approach

1. **Comprehensiveness Check:** Ensure all major components from the original diagram appear in at least one focused diagram
2. **Audience Testing:** Validate that each diagram serves its intended audience effectively
3. **Complexity Validation:** Confirm node counts stay within specified limits
4. **Cross-Reference Accuracy:** Verify that references between diagrams are accurate and helpful

### Content Review Process

1. **Technical Accuracy:** Ensure all diagrams accurately represent the actual system
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Confirm the flow from high-level to detailed makes sense
3. **Completeness:** Verify that someone could understand the full system by reading all focused diagrams
4. **Redundancy Check:** Ensure focused diagrams don't unnecessarily duplicate information

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Create High-Level Overview
- Extract major architectural layers from comprehensive diagram
- Create simplified version with 10-12 nodes
- Add explanatory text and context

### Phase 2: Create Domain-Specific Diagrams
- Build AI agents diagram with Nova model focus
- Create API/auth diagram with security emphasis
- Develop workflow diagram showing event orchestration
- Design data architecture diagram with storage patterns

### Phase 3: Integrate and Cross-Reference
- Add navigation between diagrams
- Create cross-reference annotations
- Ensure comprehensive diagram remains accessible
- Add explanatory text for each section

### Phase 4: Content Organization
- Restructure README architecture section
- Add clear headings and navigation
- Include audience guidance for each diagram
- Maintain existing comprehensive diagram as reference

## Design Decisions

### Why Five Focused Diagrams?
- Covers all major architectural concerns without overlap
- Each serves a distinct audience and use case
- Manageable number for navigation and maintenance
- Aligns with natural system boundaries

### Why Keep Comprehensive Diagram?
- Some developers need the complete picture
- Serves as authoritative reference for system interactions
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing documentation
- Provides validation that focused diagrams are complete

### Why Progressive Disclosure Pattern?
- Reduces cognitive load for new developers
- Allows deep dives into specific areas of interest
- Matches how developers typically explore new systems
- Improves documentation accessibility and usability
