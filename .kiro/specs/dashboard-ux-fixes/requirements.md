# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple user experience issues with the dashboard interface, including personalization, navigation, visual styling, and authentication flow improvements. The goal is to create a more polished and intuitive dashboard experience that properly welcomes users, provides clear navigation, and handles authentication states correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see a personalized welcome message with my first name, so that I feel recognized and the interface feels more personal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display "Welcome back [FirstName]" where FirstName is extracted from the user's full name
2. WHEN the user's profile contains a full name THEN the system SHALL parse and extract the first name portion
3. IF the first name cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL display a generic "Welcome back" message
4. WHEN the user's name changes THEN the welcome message SHALL update to reflect the new first name

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing the dashboard, I want the gradient heading text to display properly without visual cutoffs, so that I can read all content clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text with descenders (g, j, p, q, y) appears in gradient headings THEN the system SHALL display the complete letterforms without clipping
2. WHEN gradient styles are applied to text THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate padding or line-height to prevent cutoffs
3. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the text SHALL remain fully visible and readable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Create New Post" and "Create Your First Post" buttons to navigate me to the post creation interface, so that I can actually create content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Create New Post" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the post creation page
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create Your First Post" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the post creation page
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT refresh the current dashboard page
4. WHEN the post creation page loads THEN the user SHALL be able to create new content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user viewing the dashboard, I want clean navigation without duplicate or confusing elements, so that I can navigate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display only one "Dashboard" navigation element with an icon
2. WHEN breadcrumbs are present THEN the system SHALL remove the duplicate dashboard text from breadcrumbs
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the navigation SHALL be clear and unambiguous
4. WHEN the header loads THEN dashboard elements SHALL be properly positioned and not appear floating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want streamlined context menu options that don't duplicate primary navigation, so that I have a cleaner interface without redundant options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the avatar THEN the context menu SHALL NOT display "Profile Settings" option
2. WHEN the context menu appears THEN it SHALL only show options not available in primary navigation
3. WHEN a user needs profile access THEN they SHALL use the primary navigation profile option
4. WHEN the context menu displays THEN it SHALL provide unique functionality not duplicated elsewhere

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in user visiting the root URL, I want to be automatically directed to my dashboard, so that I don't have to manually navigate after authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user visits the root URL (/) THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user visits the root URL THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
3. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL verify the user's current login state
4. WHEN redirecting authenticated users THEN the system SHALL preserve any query parameters or state information
5. WHEN the redirect occurs THEN it SHALL happen automatically without user intervention
