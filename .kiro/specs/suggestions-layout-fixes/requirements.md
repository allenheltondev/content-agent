# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the suggestions display system from showing all suggestions in a sidebar to an "active suggestion area" that focuses on one suggestion at a time. Instead of listing all suggestions, users will interact with suggestions individually through highlighted text in the content and navigation controls in the active suggestion panel. This approach emphasizes the content while providing a clean, focused way to review and act on suggestions without overwhelming the interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to focus on one suggestion at a time through an active suggestion area, so that I can review suggestions without being overwhelmed by a long list and can maintain focus on my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suggestions are available THEN only one suggestion SHALL be shown as "active" in the suggestion area at a time
2. WHEN no suggestion is active THEN the active suggestion area SHALL be hidden or show a minimal placeholder
3. WHEN a suggestion becomes active THEN its corresponding text SHALL be highlighted in the main content
4. WHEN multiple suggestions exist THEN users SHALL be able to navigate between them using previous/next controls
5. WHEN a suggestion is resolved (accepted/rejected) THEN the next available suggestion SHALL automatically become active
6. WHEN all suggestions are resolved THEN the active suggestion area SHALL be hidden

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to easily identify which suggestion is currently active by clicking on highlighted text in my content, so that I can quickly jump to specific suggestions I want to review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text has suggestions THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted in the content area
2. WHEN a user clicks on highlighted text THEN the corresponding suggestion SHALL become the active suggestion
3. WHEN a suggestion is active THEN its highlighted text SHALL have a distinct visual state (e.g., stronger highlight)
4. WHEN multiple suggestions overlap the same text THEN clicking SHALL cycle through the relevant suggestions
5. WHEN a suggestion is resolved THEN its highlighting SHALL be removed from the content
6. WHEN no suggestions remain for a text area THEN all highlighting SHALL be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to navigate between suggestions using previous and next controls in the active suggestion area, so that I can review all suggestions systematically without losing my place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple suggestions exist THEN the active suggestion area SHALL display previous/next navigation controls
2. WHEN clicking the next button THEN the next available suggestion SHALL become active
3. WHEN clicking the previous button THEN the previous suggestion SHALL become active
4. WHEN on the first suggestion THEN the previous button SHALL be disabled or hidden
5. WHEN on the last suggestion THEN the next button SHALL be disabled or hidden
6. WHEN navigating between suggestions THEN the content SHALL scroll to show the active suggestion's highlighted text

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want to accept, reject, or edit suggestions directly from the active suggestion area, so that I can quickly resolve suggestions without switching contexts or losing focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a suggestion is active THEN the suggestion area SHALL display accept and reject buttons
2. WHEN clicking accept THEN the suggestion SHALL be applied to the content and the suggestion SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN clicking reject THEN the suggestion SHALL be dismissed and the suggestion SHALL be resolved
4. WHEN a suggestion allows editing THEN users SHALL be able to modify the suggested text before accepting
5. WHEN a suggestion is resolved THEN it SHALL be removed from the available suggestions
6. WHEN resolving a suggestion THEN the next available suggestion SHALL automatically become active

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want the active suggestion area to be positioned appropriately and not interfere with my writing, so that I can review suggestions while maintaining focus on my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active suggestion area is displayed THEN it SHALL be positioned to minimize interference with content editing
2. WHEN typing in the content area THEN the active suggestion area SHALL not block or interfere with text input
3. WHEN the active suggestion area is shown THEN it SHALL have appropriate sizing that doesn't dominate the interface
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the active suggestion area SHALL adapt appropriately
5. WHEN no suggestion is active THEN the suggestion area SHALL not take up unnecessary space
6. WHEN scrolling content THEN the active suggestion area SHALL remain accessible without blocking content

### Requirement 6
