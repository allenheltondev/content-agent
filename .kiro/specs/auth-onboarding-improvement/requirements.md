# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current authentication system has a critical issue where the signup flow resets to the login page instead of showing the confirmation form after successful registration. This creates a poor user experience and prevents new users from completing their account setup. Additionally, the onboarding flow lacks proper state management and user guidance throughout the registration process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete the signup process without being redirected back to the login page, so that I can confirm my account and start using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully submits the registration form THEN the system SHALL display the confirmation code form without redirecting to login
2. WHEN the registration is in progress THEN the system SHALL maintain the user's email and registration state throughout the confirmation flow
3. WHEN the user is on the confirmation screen THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect them to the dashboard until confirmation is complete
4. IF the user refreshes the page during confirmation THEN the system SHALL retain their registration state and show the confirmation form

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear feedback and guidance during the signup process, so that I understand what steps I need to complete and what to expect next.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the registration process THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions about password requirements
2. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL show a clear message explaining that a confirmation code has been sent to their email
3. WHEN the user is waiting for a confirmation code THEN the system SHALL provide options to resend the code if needed
4. WHEN confirmation is successful THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback before redirecting to the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the authentication flow to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registration error occurs THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
2. WHEN a confirmation code is invalid THEN the system SHALL allow the user to try again without losing their progress
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options and clear guidance
4. WHEN the confirmation code expires THEN the system SHALL automatically offer to resend a new code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new user, I want the signup process to be intuitive and follow modern UX patterns, so that I can complete registration quickly and confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their confirmation code THEN the system SHALL format the input field appropriately (6-digit numeric input)
2. WHEN a user completes each step THEN the system SHALL provide visual progress indicators
3. WHEN a user needs to go back to a previous step THEN the system SHALL allow navigation while preserving entered data
4. WHEN the registration process is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically sign the user in and redirect to the dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a returning user who had registration issues, I want to be able to restart the signup process cleanly, so that I can complete my account creation without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with a pending confirmation tries to register again THEN the system SHALL handle the existing account appropriately
2. WHEN a user's confirmation code expires THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path to request a new code
3. WHEN a user abandons the confirmation process THEN the system SHALL allow them to restart from the registration step
4. WHEN a user encounters repeated errors THEN the system SHALL provide alternative contact or support options
