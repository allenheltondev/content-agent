# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for a comprehensive frontend code cleanup initiative for improving code quality, maintainability, and performance. The cleanup will remove debugging artifacts, eliminate dead code, simplify over-abstracted components, and enhance code readability through self-documenting practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all debugging and informational console logs removed from the frontend codebase, so that the production application has clean console output and only shows actual errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any frontend TypeScript/JavaScript file THEN the system SHALL remove all console.log, console.info, and console.debug statements used for debugging purposes
2. WHEN an error occurs in the application THEN the system SHALL retain console.error statements for proper error logging
3. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the console SHALL only display error messages and no debugging information
4. WHEN reviewing console statements THEN the system SHALL preserve any console.warn statements that provide important user feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dead code and backward compatibility code removed from the frontend, so that the codebase is lean and focused on current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing frontend components THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused imports, functions, and variables
2. WHEN reviewing code history THEN the system SHALL remove any code marked as deprecated or for backward compatibility
3. WHEN examining component props THEN the system SHALL remove unused prop definitions and interfaces
4. WHEN checking utility functions THEN the system SHALL remove functions that have no current consumers
5. WHEN reviewing type definitions THEN the system SHALL remove unused TypeScript interfaces and types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want over-abstracted code simplified when it only has a single consumer, so that the code is more direct and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a utility function has only one consumer THEN the system SHALL inline the logic into the consuming component
2. WHEN a custom hook is used by only one component THEN the system SHALL consider moving the logic directly into the component
3. WHEN a wrapper component has only one use case THEN the system SHALL simplify or remove the abstraction
4. WHEN a service class has a single method used by one consumer THEN the system SHALL inline the functionality
5. WHEN configuration objects are used in only one place THEN the system SHALL inline the configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unnecessary comments removed and code to be self-documenting, so that the codebase is cleaner and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code comments THEN the system SHALL remove obvious comments that restate what the code does
2. WHEN examining variable and function names THEN the system SHALL ensure they are descriptive enough to eliminate need for explanatory comments
3. WHEN code has TODO comments THEN the system SHALL either implement the TODO or remove it if no longer relevant
4. WHEN comments explain complex business logic THEN the system SHALL retain those comments as they add value
5. WHEN JSDoc comments exist for public APIs THEN the system SHALL retain them for documentation purposes
6. WHEN inline comments explain "why" rather than "what" THEN the system SHALL retain them

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup process to maintain all existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing code THEN the system SHALL verify that all existing functionality continues to work
2. WHEN simplifying abstractions THEN the system SHALL ensure the same behavior is preserved
3. WHEN inlining functions THEN the system SHALL maintain the same input/output behavior
4. WHEN removing imports THEN the system SHALL verify that no runtime errors are introduced
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup to follow the project's coding standards, so that the refactored code maintains consistency with the established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL follow the project's TypeScript and React conventions
2. WHEN simplifying components THEN the system SHALL maintain the established component structure patterns
3. WHEN removing abstractions THEN the system SHALL ensure the resulting code follows the "simplicity above all else" principle
4. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL use the project's preferred import patterns
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the code SHALL pass all linting and formatting checks
