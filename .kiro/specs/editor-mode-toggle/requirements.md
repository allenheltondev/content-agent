# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical usability issue where users cannot edit their content when suggestions are displayed in the editor. The solution introduces an Edit/Review mode toggle that allows users to switch between actively editing their content and reviewing suggestions, providing a clear separation of concerns and improving the overall editing experience.

3. WHEN in Review mode THEN users SHALL be able to accept, reject, or modify suggestions
4. WHEN in Review mode THEN the content SHALL be read-only or have limited editing to prevent accidental changes
5. WHEN in Review mode THEN suggestion actions (accept/reject) SHALL update the content appropriately
6. WHEN in Review mode THEN users SHALL be able to navigate between suggestions efficiently

### Requirement 4

6. WHEN switching modes THEN there SHALL be a smooth visual transition to indicate the change

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a blog writer, I want suggestions to remain accurate and properly positioned after I edit content, so that I can trust the feedback when I return to Review mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is modified in Edit mode THEN the system SHALL track all content changes
2. WHEN switching from Edit to Review mode THEN the system SHALL recalculate suggestion positions based on current content
3. WHEN suggestion positions become invalid due to content changes THEN the system SHALL update or remove outdated suggestions
