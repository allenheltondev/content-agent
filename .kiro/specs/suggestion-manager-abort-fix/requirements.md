# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `useSuggestionManager` hook is experiencing issues with AbortController implementation causing "signal is aborted without reason" errors. The hook is aborting fetch requests prematurely due to dependency cycles in the `loadSuggestions` callback, leading to failed API calls and poor user experience. This feature will fix the AbortController logic to ensure proper request cancellation without premature aborts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the suggestion manager hook, I want API requests to be properly cancelled only when necessary, so that I don't see "signal is aborted without reason" errors in the console.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `loadSuggestions` function is called THEN the system SHALL only abort existing requests if a new request is being made for a different post
2. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL abort any pending requests
3. WHEN a request is in progress and the same request is called again THEN the system SHALL not abort the existing request
4. WHEN the `loadSuggestions` callback dependencies change THEN the system SHALL not automatically abort existing requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the blog editor, I want suggestions to load reliably without network errors, so that I can see and interact with all available suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to a post with suggestions THEN the system SHALL load suggestions without AbortError exceptions
2. WHEN suggestions are loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading state
3. WHEN suggestions fail to load due to network issues THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message
4. WHEN suggestions load successfully THEN the system SHALL display all available suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the suggestion manager to have stable callback dependencies, so that components using the hook don't re-render unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `loadSuggestions` callback is created THEN the system SHALL not include state values that cause unnecessary re-creation
2. WHEN filtering suggestions THEN the system SHALL do so in the return value rather than in the callback dependencies
3. WHEN the hook state changes THEN the system SHALL not recreate callbacks unless absolutely necessary
4. WHEN callbacks are stable THEN the system SHALL prevent unnecessary component re-renders
