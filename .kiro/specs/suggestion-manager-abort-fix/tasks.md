# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Refactor state management and request tracking





  - Modify the internal state interface to store all suggestions instead of filtered ones
  - Add request manager ref to track current request state without causing re-renders
  - Update state initialization to include currentPostId tracking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1_

- [x] 2. Fix loadSuggestions callback dependencies and logic





  - Remove acceptedSuggestions and rejectedSuggestions from loadSuggestions dependencies
  - Implement request deduplication to prevent multiple simultaneous requests for same post
  - Add proper abort conditions that only abort when loading different posts or unmounting
  - Store raw API response in state instead of pre-filtered suggestions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Implement proper AbortError handling





  - Update error handling to distinguish between AbortError and actual network errors
  - Handle AbortError silently without showing user-facing error messages
  - Ensure loading state is properly cleared for both error types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Move suggestion filtering to return value computation





  - Create getActiveSuggestions function that filters from allSuggestions state
  - Update hook return value to use filtered suggestions instead of state.suggestions
  - Ensure filtering logic accounts for accepted and rejected suggestions
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Update cleanup and unmount handling





  - Ensure AbortController is properly cleaned up on component unmount
  - Add request manager cleanup in useEffect cleanup function
  - Verify no memory leaks from AbortController references
  - _Requirements: 1.2_

- [ ]* 6. Add comprehensive error logging and debugging
  - Add structured logging for request lifecycle events
  - Include request timing and abort reason logging for debugging
  - Add performance metrics for callback recreation tracking
  - _Requirements: 2.3_
