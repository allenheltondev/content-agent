# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current delete-post function only removes the main post content but leaves behind related data including suggestions, audit reports, and other associated records. This creates data inconsistency and potential storage waste. This feature will enhance the delete-post functionality to comprehensively remove all related data asynchronously, ensuring complete cleanup while maintaining fast response times for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog author, I want to delete a post completely so that all associated data (suggestions, audit reports) is also removed and doesn't clutter my workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes a post THEN the system SHALL remove the main post content immediately
2. WHEN a user deletes a post THEN the system SHALL asynchronously remove all related suggestions for that post
3. WHEN a user deletes a post THEN the system SHALL asynchronously remove all audit reports for that post
4. WHEN a user deletes a post THEN the system SHALL return a success response without waiting for cleanup completion
5. IF cleanup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors but not affect the user experience

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive post deletion to be efficient so that it doesn't impact system performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN post deletion is triggered THEN the main post deletion SHALL complete within 2 seconds
2. WHEN cleanup operations run THEN they SHALL execute asynchronously without blocking the API response
3. WHEN multiple related items exist THEN the system SHALL use batch operations for efficient deletion
4. WHEN cleanup operations run THEN they SHALL use appropriate DynamoDB query patterns to find all related data
5. IF cleanup operations encounter errors THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deletion process to be reliable so that no orphaned data remains in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying for related data THEN the system SHALL use the correct partition key patterns (`${tenantId}#${contentId}`)
2. WHEN deleting suggestions THEN the system SHALL remove all items with sort key pattern `suggestion#*`
3. WHEN deleting audit reports THEN the system SHALL remove all items with sort key pattern `audit#*`
4. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL log the number of items deleted for each data type
5. IF partial cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL log which operations succeeded and which failed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want deletion operations to maintain data integrity so that tenant isolation is preserved and statistics are updated correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting post data THEN the system SHALL only delete data belonging to the authenticated tenant
2. WHEN post deletion completes THEN the system SHALL update tenant statistics to decrement post count
3. WHEN suggestions are deleted THEN the system SHALL update tenant statistics appropriately
4. WHEN cleanup operations run THEN they SHALL validate tenant ownership before deletion
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and log the security event
